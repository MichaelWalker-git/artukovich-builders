## Why You Need Google Business Profile

Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is **critical** for local contractors. When people search "custom home builders near me" or "general contractors Montana," your listings appear in:
- Google Search results
- Google Maps
- Local pack (top 3 businesses shown)

For contractors, this drives 60%+ of new leads.
