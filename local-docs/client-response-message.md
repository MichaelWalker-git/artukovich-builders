## My Recommendation for Your Brand Presentation:

**Lead with Artukovich Builders** for your custom home marketing, while clearly showing WMA Services Company Inc. as your comprehensive construction operation. Here's why this works perfectly:

### For High-End Custom Homes ($500K+):
- **Artukovich Builders** becomes your premium brand
- Positions you as the luxury custom home specialist in Montana
- "Crafting Montana Dreams" messaging
- Perfect for Bozeman, Big Sky, Whitefish luxury markets

### For Everything Else:
- **WMA Services Company Inc.** handles general contracting
- Renovations, additions, commercial work
- "Your Complete Construction Partner"
- Broader market appeal

## What I've Built For You:

I've created a complete website strategy that implements this exact approach:
